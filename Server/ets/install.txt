SETTING UP & RUNNING THE ETS SERVER SUITE
=========================================

Note: there is no need to be a super user to install the ETS SS

- Enter the directory and run "bin/server.sh install"
- If the installation process ends without errors and you already have edited
  the config.json file (as proposed by the installation procedure itself)
  you'll now be ready to run the server
  - First of all you should run "bin/server.sh test" and see if everything is
    all right. You could possibily receive an error regarding the web site
    not being accessible. Until then you can't run the server.
  - Run the site web server (the real one or the Development Server)
  - Run the server with "bin/server.sh start"
    The server will run every service (mhs, ehs, ths) and then will go into
    the background.
- The setup.sh script accepts also the "log", "stop", and "status" command.
  Interactively read the log with "log", see which components are on with "status"
  and stop the whole process with "stop"
